# Supplementary Course Resources

This repository contains course code and other resources (e.g. slides) that are shown, created or used in our [complete web development course](https://acad.link/web-dev).

You may use these resources to compare your code against our code snapshots (e.g. to find + fix errors) or to download and view the slides shown in the lectures.

# How To Find The Right Resources

The resources are organized into various branches. **Every branch (except for the "main" branch) belongs to a specific course section** - the branch name indicates which section it belongs to. For example, the branch [01-getting-started](/academind/100-days-of-web-development/tree/01-getting-started) belongs to the first course section "Getting Started".

Inside each branch, you find folders that contain the various resources:

- `/code` contains the section code snapshots 
- `/slides` contains the section slides

# Using The Code Snapshots

After switching to a specific branch, you find the code snapshots for that branch in the `/code` folder.

You can dive into that folder and view the code right here on GitHub. Alternatively, if you want to use and view the code locally, you can download the entire branch resources via the "Code" button. Or by [cloning the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
